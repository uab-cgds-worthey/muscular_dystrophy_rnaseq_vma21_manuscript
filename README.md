## Muscular Dystrophy RNA-Seq Analysis
X-linked myopathy with excessive autophagy (XMEA) is caused by loss-of-function (LoF) pathogenic variants in the _VMA21_ gene on the X-chromosome. XMEA patients develop a progressive muscle weakness caused by an impaired autophagy process resulting in the accumulation of vacuoles within skeletal muscle, liver and neurons.
